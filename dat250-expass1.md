# Software Technology Experiment Assignment 1

In this assignment I have made sure to have a working Software Development Environment installed. This has also been validated, although some issues have been encountered. 

JDK, and IDE and Maven was software already available, so no installation needed - but validation took place through the terminal to make sure everything looks OK. 

### results from commands:

java -version -> 
java version "1.8.0_111"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_111-b14)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.111-b14, mixed mode)

This version should be sufficient as far as I know and have read. 


 mvn -version ->
 Apache Maven 3.6.3
 
 git --version ->
 git version 2.24.1 (Apple Git-126)
 
 
 ### Deploying Java applications on the Heroku cloud platform
 
 This process was relatively straight forward, but some issues arised at the end.
