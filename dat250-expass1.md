# Software Technology Experiment Assignment 1

In this assignment I have made sure to have a working Software Development Environment installed. This has also been validated.

JDK, and IDE and Maven was software already available, so no installation needed - but validation took place through the terminal to make sure everything looks OK. 

### Results from commands:

java -version -> 
java version "1.8.0_111"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_111-b14)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.111-b14, mixed mode)

This version should be sufficient as far as I know and have read. 


 mvn -version ->
 Apache Maven 3.6.3
 
 git --version ->
 git version 2.24.1 (Apple Git-126)
 
 
 ### Deploying Java applications on the Heroku cloud platform
 
 This process was relatively straight forward, but some issues arised at the end. One issue I have not resolved yet is an issue with postgres due to having complications with earlier version occupying ports.
 
 The app is connected to git and github and apart from the above mentioned problems, deployment and tutorial seems to have worked sufficiently. 
 
 Screenshot from Heroku activity and build log is attatched.
